# Liver Lesion Hackathon With Ultrasound Image

AIAT hackathon with the aim of developing a deep learning model that can accurately detect if an image corresponds to a specific disease. The challenge is to create a machine learning algorithm that can analyze various types of images and accurately determine whether or not the image represents the disease in question.
